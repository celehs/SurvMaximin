Description: For multi-center heterogeneous Real World Data (RWD) with time-to-event outcomes and 
    high-dimensional features, this package provides the SurvMaximin algorithm to estimate Cox model feature
    coefficients for a target population by borrowing summary information from a set of health care centers
    without sharing patient-level information. For each of the centers from which we want to borrow information
    to improve the prediction performance for the target population, a penalized Cox model is fitted to estimate
    feature coefficients for the center. Using estimated feature coefficients and the covariance matrix of the 
    target population, it then obtains a SurvMaximin estimated set of feature coefficients for the target population.
    The target population can be an entire cohort comprised of all centers, corresponding to federated learning, or
    can be a single center, corresponding to transfer learning.
