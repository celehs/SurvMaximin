# SurvMaximin

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

For multi-center heterogeneous Real-World Data (RWD) with time-to-event outcomes and high-dimensional features, we propose the SurvMaximin algorithm to estimate Cox model feature coefficients for a target population by borrowing summary information from a set of health care centers without sharing patient-level information.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SurvMaximin like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("celehs/SurvMaximin")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(SurvMaximin)
## basic example code
```
