# SurvMaximin

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

For multi-center heterogeneous Real-World Data (RWD) with time-to-event
outcomes and high-dimensional features, we propose the SurvMaximin
algorithm to estimate Cox model feature coefficients for a target
population by borrowing summary information from a set of health care
centers without sharing patient-level information. An interactive online
shiny app ([SurvMaximin](https://shiny.parse-health.org/SurvMaximin/))
has been implemented to perform the proposed algorithm with user input
data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SurvMaximin like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("celehs/SurvMaximin")
```

## Example

``` r
library(SurvMaximin)
## basic example code
```
